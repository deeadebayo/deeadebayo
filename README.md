# 👋🏿Hi, I'm Adeolu

I'm a software engineer who is trying my best™️ to mix art and creativity with all the fun of the internet™. I really enjoy working with ReactJS, GraphQL, and other technologies in the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup). I'd love the opportunity to use these skills to elevate people and build lasting communities.
